<strong style="font-size: 24px;">REACT + VITE Project</strong>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">
This project is based on the todo lists with three statuses (to-do, in-progress, done). There are lists of tasks saved for particular accounts. I have used Firebase to get the auth token. For the rest of the login process and data storage, I have used localStorage, where we store different users' data and make different storage partitions for different users. We can log in, sign up, and delete accounts in this app. We can store our data within a particular account's storage and update the list according to deadlines.

Functionalities in list:

1. Login, Signup, DeleteAccount, Logout
2. Todo list: Add List, Update List, Delete List
